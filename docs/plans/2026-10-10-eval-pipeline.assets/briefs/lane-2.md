# Lane brief (plan slice, verbatim)

# Implementation Plan: Eval Pipeline (regression cases from findings, suite runs, code-only scoring, dashboards)
Status: ready
Spec: specs/2026-10-10-eval-pipeline.md (SPEC-2026-10-10-eval-pipeline, approved by Glib 2026-10-10; proof tags updated in 3f6b113)
Execution mode: multi-agent, chosen by the user. Lanes run as sonnet implementers (`.claude/agents/README.md` table).
Save as: docs/plans/2026-10-10-eval-pipeline.md
Architecture decisions: `/Users/Glebazzz/Claude/PROJECTS/NEO/decisions/2026-10-10-eval-suite-runs-table.md` (Accepted, with Follow-up and Follow-up 2, both accepted by Glib)
reviewer-core: unchanged. `reviewPullRequest` already returns grounded findings, `dropped` with reasons, and `costUsd` (`reviewer-core/src/review/run.ts:103-121`), which is everything AC-14, AC-15 and AC-24 need.


## Constraints
- Contracts are additive. The existing `EvalCase`, `EvalCaseInput`, `EvalRunRecord`, `EvalRun`, `EvalTrendPoint` and `EvalDashboard` are unchanged; new nullable-metric shapes live in new names. Edit the server copy first, mirror byte-identically to the client, and check `diff server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/eval-pipeline.ts client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/eval-pipeline.ts` (empty). Source: `.claude/rules/shared-contracts.md:9-14`; main-session coordination.
- Schema changes go through `server/src/db/schema/eval.ts`, then `pnpm db:generate`, then `pnpm db:migrate` (local DB on port 5632 per `CLAUDE.local.md`). Never hand-edit `server/src/db/migrations/**`. Source: root `CLAUDE.md` Do-not-touch; `.claude/rules/db-schema.md:9-12`.
- Routes parse, call the service and map; no query, no adapter call. Composition goes in `modules/eval/wiring.ts` as `buildEvalService(container, log, opts)`. Source: `.claude/rules/onion-boundaries.md:16-20`; onion-architecture steps 2 and 3.
- `service.ts` and `case-runner.ts` import no `fastify`, `drizzle-orm`, `src/db/**` or adapter. `parseUnifiedDiff` and `container.llm` come in as ports; agent, skill and finding data comes through container repos in wiring. Source: `.claude/rules/onion-boundaries.md:21-29`.
- `scoring.ts` and `compare.ts` are pure: they import only types from `@devdigest/shared` and `./types.js`. No I/O, no clock, no randomness, no tokenizer. They will be mutation-tested later. Source: main-session coordination; spec NFR Performance.
- Background execution goes through the `background(task)` port filled in wiring with `void task().catch(log)`. No `container.jobs`. A boot reaper marks leftover `running` runs. Source: ADR follow-up 2 (`../decisions/2026-10-10-eval-suite-runs-table.md:50-56`).
- reviewer-core is not changed. Source: spec header; main-session coordination.
- Case text never enters trusted framing: `task = EVAL_TASK` (constant), and title and body go in `prDescription`. Provider error text shown to users is the fixed `CASE_ERROR`; raw text goes to the log after `redactSecrets`. Source: spec Untrusted inputs and NFR Security; `server/INSIGHTS.md:30`.
- Every route declares `schema.response` with the shared contract. Polled GETs (`/eval-suite-runs/:id`, `/eval-case-runs/:id`) set `config: { rateLimit: false }`. The three run POSTs set `{ max: 10, timeWindow: '1 minute' }`. Source: `server/INSIGHTS.md:14`; `server/src/modules/brief/routes.ts:23,34`.
- Client placement: pieces used by both `/agents/[id]` and `/eval/**` live in `client/src/components/eval/` (second consumer exists in this change, same shape as `components/diff-viewer/`). Everything else is colocated in `_components/<Name>/`. No new `export *`. Data flows through `src/lib/hooks/eval.ts` → `api`. Source: frontend-ui-architecture steps 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.
- Every user string comes from the `eval` namespace (plus existing `agents` tab and `shell` nav labels). Model output and case text render as text only, never Markdown, links or HTML. Source: spec NFR i18n and Security.
- `src/vendor/ui` is not edited, except the one nav item the main session approved in `client/src/vendor/ui/nav.ts`. Source: `client/AGENTS.md:21-22`; main-session coordination.
- `seed.ts` stays idempotent. Source: `.claude/rules/db-schema.md:17-18`.
- e2e flows read seeded data only and trigger no LLM call. Source: `e2e/docs/hermetic-stack.md:53`; `e2e/run.ts:16`.


## Skills for the implementer
- client/** → frontend-ui-architecture, next-best-practices, react-best-practices, react-testing-library, security, zod
- server/** → onion-architecture, fastify-best-practices, drizzle-orm-patterns, security, zod
- server/src/db/** → the server row plus postgresql-table-design
- e2e/** → no skill; follow `e2e/CLAUDE.md`

## Steps (this lane)
6. [BE] server — EvalRepository implementing EvalStore
   - files: `server/src/modules/eval/repository.ts` (new: `export class EvalRepository implements EvalStore { constructor(db: Db) }`, delegating to the entity repos); `server/src/modules/eval/repository/case.repo.ts`, `suite-run.repo.ts`, `case-run.repo.ts` (new)
   - layer: repository · lane: 2
   - skills: drizzle-orm-patterns, postgresql-table-design, onion-architecture, security
   - turns green: none alone (AC-11, 27, 32, 42, 45, 57, 58 via step 11)
   - test first: none here; the step 11 integration files exercise every method against Postgres. Self-check by typecheck.
   - interfaces: consumes `EvalStore` and the record types (step 3), tables (step 2). Produces `EvalRepository`.
     - Every read and update filters by `workspaceId` where the signature has one.
     - `insertCase` uses `onConflictDoNothing({target: [agentId, sourceFindingId]})` and, when no row is returned, selects the existing one (`created: false`).
     - `insertSuite` computes `run_number = coalesce(max(run_number),0)+1` for the agent in the same statement. It maps a unique violation (`23505`) on either index to `'already_running'`.
     - `listSuites` selects no `snapshot` column and orders `started_at desc, run_number desc`.
     - `lastResults` uses `DISTINCT ON (case_id)` over `status <> 'running'` ordered `ran_at desc`.
     - `insertCaseRun` returns `undefined` on FK violation `23503` (case deleted).
     - `finish*` and `updateSuiteProgress` return `false` when 0 rows are updated.
     - `reapInterrupted` sets running suites to `failed` + reason + `finished_at`, and running case runs to `errored` + reason.
     - Aggregates are raw `sql<number|null>`.
   - verify: `cd server && pnpm typecheck` → no error in `src/modules/eval/repository*` (judged on owned paths)

## Contracts & data
- **Shared contract:** `contracts/eval-pipeline.ts` (step 1), server first, client mirror identical, one barrel line in each `index.ts`. Existing eval contracts unchanged.
- **Migration:** generated `0015_*.sql` (step 2) via `pnpm db:generate`, applied with `pnpm db:migrate` on the 5632 DB.
- **i18n:** `client/messages/en/eval.json`. L5 adds these keys (English as shown); L6 and L7 consume them and add none (a missing key is reported as a deviation for the main session).

## Acceptance criteria these steps trace to (verbatim)
- AC-11 WHEN "Turn into eval case" is activated for a finding that already has a case in the same agent's set, the system shall return the existing case and create no second one. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-27 IF a suite run for the same agent is already running, THEN the system shall refuse a new one with 409. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-32 The system shall number suite runs per agent from 1, in start order, and label each run "run #N · agent vM", where M is the agent's config version when the run started. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-42 WHEN the user edits or deletes a case, the system shall update or remove it. Past suite runs keep their aggregate metrics and their list of scored cases (id, name, status), while the deleted case's detailed result is removed with it. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-45 WHEN the Evals tab or the per-agent dashboard opens, the system shall list that agent's suite runs newest first. Each row shows ran-at, the "run #N · agent vM" label, status, recall, precision, citation accuracy, passed / executed cases, the errored count when not zero, and cost. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-57 WHEN an agent is deleted, the system shall delete its cases, suite runs and case results with it. — proof: red-first integration
- AC-58 WHEN an agent has 50 suite runs, the system shall answer the per-agent dashboard, workspace dashboard and history routes with p95 under 500 ms. — proof: red-first integration
