# Lane brief (plan slice, verbatim)

# Implementation Plan: Eval Pipeline (regression cases from findings, suite runs, code-only scoring, dashboards)
Status: ready
Spec: specs/2026-10-10-eval-pipeline.md (SPEC-2026-10-10-eval-pipeline, approved by Glib 2026-10-10; proof tags updated in 3f6b113)
Execution mode: multi-agent, chosen by the user. Lanes run as sonnet implementers (`.claude/agents/README.md` table).
Save as: docs/plans/2026-10-10-eval-pipeline.md
Architecture decisions: `/Users/Glebazzz/Claude/PROJECTS/NEO/decisions/2026-10-10-eval-suite-runs-table.md` (Accepted, with Follow-up and Follow-up 2, both accepted by Glib)
reviewer-core: unchanged. `reviewPullRequest` already returns grounded findings, `dropped` with reasons, and `costUsd` (`reviewer-core/src/review/run.ts:103-121`), which is everything AC-14, AC-15 and AC-24 need.


## Constraints
- Contracts are additive. The existing `EvalCase`, `EvalCaseInput`, `EvalRunRecord`, `EvalRun`, `EvalTrendPoint` and `EvalDashboard` are unchanged; new nullable-metric shapes live in new names. Edit the server copy first, mirror byte-identically to the client, and check `diff server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/eval-pipeline.ts client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/eval-pipeline.ts` (empty). Source: `.claude/rules/shared-contracts.md:9-14`; main-session coordination.
- Schema changes go through `server/src/db/schema/eval.ts`, then `pnpm db:generate`, then `pnpm db:migrate` (local DB on port 5632 per `CLAUDE.local.md`). Never hand-edit `server/src/db/migrations/**`. Source: root `CLAUDE.md` Do-not-touch; `.claude/rules/db-schema.md:9-12`.
- Routes parse, call the service and map; no query, no adapter call. Composition goes in `modules/eval/wiring.ts` as `buildEvalService(container, log, opts)`. Source: `.claude/rules/onion-boundaries.md:16-20`; onion-architecture steps 2 and 3.
- `service.ts` and `case-runner.ts` import no `fastify`, `drizzle-orm`, `src/db/**` or adapter. `parseUnifiedDiff` and `container.llm` come in as ports; agent, skill and finding data comes through container repos in wiring. Source: `.claude/rules/onion-boundaries.md:21-29`.
- `scoring.ts` and `compare.ts` are pure: they import only types from `@devdigest/shared` and `./types.js`. No I/O, no clock, no randomness, no tokenizer. They will be mutation-tested later. Source: main-session coordination; spec NFR Performance.
- Background execution goes through the `background(task)` port filled in wiring with `void task().catch(log)`. No `container.jobs`. A boot reaper marks leftover `running` runs. Source: ADR follow-up 2 (`../decisions/2026-10-10-eval-suite-runs-table.md:50-56`).
- reviewer-core is not changed. Source: spec header; main-session coordination.
- Case text never enters trusted framing: `task = EVAL_TASK` (constant), and title and body go in `prDescription`. Provider error text shown to users is the fixed `CASE_ERROR`; raw text goes to the log after `redactSecrets`. Source: spec Untrusted inputs and NFR Security; `server/INSIGHTS.md:30`.
- Every route declares `schema.response` with the shared contract. Polled GETs (`/eval-suite-runs/:id`, `/eval-case-runs/:id`) set `config: { rateLimit: false }`. The three run POSTs set `{ max: 10, timeWindow: '1 minute' }`. Source: `server/INSIGHTS.md:14`; `server/src/modules/brief/routes.ts:23,34`.
- Client placement: pieces used by both `/agents/[id]` and `/eval/**` live in `client/src/components/eval/` (second consumer exists in this change, same shape as `components/diff-viewer/`). Everything else is colocated in `_components/<Name>/`. No new `export *`. Data flows through `src/lib/hooks/eval.ts` → `api`. Source: frontend-ui-architecture steps 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.
- Every user string comes from the `eval` namespace (plus existing `agents` tab and `shell` nav labels). Model output and case text render as text only, never Markdown, links or HTML. Source: spec NFR i18n and Security.
- `src/vendor/ui` is not edited, except the one nav item the main session approved in `client/src/vendor/ui/nav.ts`. Source: `client/AGENTS.md:21-22`; main-session coordination.
- `seed.ts` stays idempotent. Source: `.claude/rules/db-schema.md:17-18`.
- e2e flows read seeded data only and trigger no LLM call. Source: `e2e/docs/hermetic-stack.md:53`; `e2e/run.ts:16`.


## Skills for the implementer
- client/** → frontend-ui-architecture, next-best-practices, react-best-practices, react-testing-library, security, zod
- server/** → onion-architecture, fastify-best-practices, drizzle-orm-patterns, security, zod
- server/src/db/** → the server row plus postgresql-table-design
- e2e/** → no skill; follow `e2e/CLAUDE.md`


## Lanes (this lane's row)
| lane | steps | owned paths | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 22 | `server/src/db/seed.ts`, `e2e/specs/10-eval-dashboard.flow.json`, `e2e/specs/11-agent-evals-tab.flow.json`, `e2e/specs/12-finding-eval-button.flow.json` | 4, 6, 7 |

## Steps (this lane)
22. [BE/UI] seed and e2e — read-only eval views
    - files: `server/src/db/seed.ts` (changed: an idempotent eval demo block, inserted only when no `eval_cases` row exists for the workspace); `e2e/specs/10-eval-dashboard.flow.json`, `11-agent-evals-tab.flow.json`, `12-finding-eval-button.flow.json` (new)
    - layer: seed / e2e · lane: 8
    - skills: drizzle-orm-patterns, postgresql-table-design (seed); e2e follows `e2e/CLAUDE.md`
    - turns green: AC-9 (UI half), AC-36, AC-37, AC-40, AC-51, AC-52, AC-55
    - test first: the flows themselves.
      - Seed:
        - "Security Reviewer" gets 4 cases (named passed, failed, errored and never-run demo cases, with eval_runs rows for the first three) and 2 done suites;
        - "Performance Reviewer" gets 1 case and 1 done suite;
        - "Test Quality Reviewer" keeps 0 cases (AC-37);
        - one seeded finding stays undecided (AC-9).
      - Flows (only `open`, `wait --url`, `wait --text`, `find` locators; no LLM, no writes):
        - 10: sidebar "Eval Dashboard" → `/eval`, two agent rows, the recent-runs list; open an agent row → per-agent dashboard; switch agent.
        - 11: `/agents/<id>?tab=evals` → "passing 1 / 4" and the four states; the no-cases agent shows the empty text; open New eval case, fill the diff, Preview shows the added line.
        - 12: PR detail → expand the undecided finding → "Accept or dismiss first".
    - interfaces: consumes the tables from step 2 and the UI from steps 15–21
    - verify: `cd e2e && npm run typecheck` → exit 0. The main session runs `E2E_PG_PORT=5633 E2E_API_PORT=3301 E2E_WEB_PORT=3300 npm run e2e:hermetic`.

## Contracts & data
- **Shared contract:** `contracts/eval-pipeline.ts` (step 1), server first, client mirror identical, one barrel line in each `index.ts`. Existing eval contracts unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria these steps trace to (verbatim)
- AC-9 WHILE a finding has neither an accepted nor a dismissed decision, the system shall show "Turn into eval case" disabled with the hint "Accept or dismiss first". The create route refuses such a finding with 422. — proof: e2e
- AC-36 WHEN the Evals tab of an agent opens, the system shall list every case in that agent's set with: its name; an expectation chip, where must-not-flag expectations are labelled "must NOT flag" and an empty list is labelled "expect clean"; its last result: passed, failed, errored or never run; for a run case, a "matched x of y expected" line; a "passing p / n" count above the list. — proof: e2e
- AC-37 IF an agent has no cases, THEN the Evals tab shall show the empty-state text and the "New eval case" action, and "Run all evals" shall be disabled. — proof: e2e
- AC-40 WHILE the user edits the diff in the Case Editor, the system shall show a rendered diff preview of it. — proof: e2e
- AC-51 The system shall show an "Eval Dashboard" item in the sidebar's Skills Lab section, opening the Eval Dashboard page. — proof: e2e
- AC-52 WHEN the Eval Dashboard opens, the system shall list every agent in the workspace that has at least one case. Each row shows the agent name, model, latest suite-run label and date, passed / executed, a recall trend sparkline, and the latest recall, precision and citation accuracy. Below the list, the 20 most recent suite runs of all agents appear newest first. — proof: e2e
- AC-55 WHEN the user opens an agent's row on the Eval Dashboard, or "View full dashboard" on its Evals tab, the system shall open the per-agent dashboard. It shows stat cards (latest value and delta against the previous completed run), the trend chart, the run history with selection and Compare, a "Run eval" action, and an agent switcher that changes the agent in place. — proof: e2e
